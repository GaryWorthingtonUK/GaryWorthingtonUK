# 👋 Hi, I’m Gary Worthington

I’m a software engineer, delivery consultant, and fractional CTO helping startups build products that *don’t fall apart at scale*.  
Over the last 20 years, I’ve led teams at startups and enterprises alike — from scaling **Yepic** from zero to 15,000 users in a year, to architecting secure FHIR-based APIs for **NHS England**, to guiding early-stage founders through the messy middle between MVP and market fit.  
At **[More Than Monkeys](https://morethanmonkeys.co.uk)**, I help startups and scaleups validate ideas, architect scalable systems, and build software that balances speed with sustainability.

### 🧠 What I Work On

- **Product Engineering** — turning half-baked ideas into reliable, scalable platforms  
- **Python / Django / FastAPI** — with typed code, modern tooling, and real tests  
- **Terraform / AWS** — multi-account, multi-region IaC done properly  
- **React / Next.js** — simple, fast frontends that teams can actually maintain  
- **DevOps & CI/CD** — because shipping safely shouldn’t mean slowing down

### 🧰 Current Projects

- **NHS GP Registrations Service** — secure FHIR APIs using AWS Lambda & ECS  
- **Mergent Skills** — SaaS for workforce skills management (Next.js + Django + AWS)  
- **Yepic** — Flutter mobile app with AWS Amplify & GraphQL sync  
- **More Than Monkeys Platform** — our internal templates for high-quality startup builds

### 🧪 Principles I Live By

- Tests are part of the codebase, not an afterthought  
- “Agile” means delivering outcomes, not ticking Jira boxes  
- Simplicity scales better than cleverness  
- If you can’t automate it, document it (then automate it later)
